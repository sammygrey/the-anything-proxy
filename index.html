    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h3>
      This proxy is designed to work with a number of different requests
      utilizing the Fetch feature that is currently experimental in Node.js.
      <br />
      Below you will find features this proxy allows and how to use them:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Basic Usage:</h3>
        <p>
          Type in any URL in the box above or append it to this sites URL to
          create a proxy-request. This will render any data a request to the URL
          yielded on this site alongside sending it to any program that
          requested it.
        </p>
        <h4>Using Custom Headers and Options:</h4>
        <p>
          To use headers alongside your request add a header to your request for
          "use_headers" set to true as its value.
          <br />
          For custom request options add another header titled "custom_options"
          with it's value set to a JSON of your custom HTTP options.
          <br />

        <h3>Supported Request Types:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Simple JSON Requests:</h4>
            <p>
              Making JSON requests is the main functionality of this program.
              <br />
              To make a request for a JSON simply append any request URL to this
              sites address.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>HTML and Text Requests:</h4>
            <p>
              To make a request for a site's text append the request to this
              sites url prefaced by /text/.
              <br />
              Alongside the text, whatever styling is present on the site will
              also be rendered unless that styling or content is JS-based.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Post Requests:</h4>
            <p>
              Like most request services you can also send data to addresses
              using post requests.
              <br />
              To do this simply preface the url you are posting to with /post/
              in this site's url and include any data you'd like to post in the
              body of your request's headers.
            </p>
          </li>
